      This easy Lasagna Recipe is meaty, cheesy, and packed with flavor in every bite. Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant version and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lasagna is the perfect meal, and of all of the recipes I&apos;ve tried over the years, this is the perfect lasagna. We loved it so much, we even turned it into Lasagna Roll Ups. It&apos;s flavorful and satisfying, but also easy to make. It’s delicious as-is, but you can make it your own by swapping in your favorite ingredients.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ground beef:</strong>  We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna.</li>
      <li><strong>Onion: </strong> we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
      <li><strong>Garlic colves: </strong> you can add more if you love garlic</li>
      <li><strong>Red wine (or beef broth): </strong> This amps up the flavor of your sauce (avoid using cooking wine).</li>
      <li><strong>Marinara sauce: </strong> Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
      <li><strong>Dried thyme: </strong> Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
      <li><strong>Sugar: </strong> balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li>
      <li><strong>Parsley: </strong> flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
      <li><strong>Lasagna noodles: </strong> Cook these al dente; they&apos;ll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Cottage cheese: </strong> adds great texture and moisture</li>
      <li><strong>egg: </strong>helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
      <li>Pour in 1/4 cup of wine and stir until almost evaporated. Add marinara, salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley; bring to a simmer, then cover and cook 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Combine all of the cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella in a mixing bowl (reserve the rest for later).</li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375ºF and cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of well-salted water until al dente.</li>
      <li>Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.</li>
      <li>Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
